Adds a MetaBox in Appearance → Menus allowing you to insert archive links of custom post types. Modernized fork of the original plugin by Stephen Harris.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a new metabox to **Appearance → Menus**, listing all public custom post types that have an archive.

From there you can easily add the archive link of any custom post type to your navigation menus — exactly like you do with pages, posts or categories.

This is a **modernized fork** of the original plugin *"WordPress Post Type Archive Links"* by Stephen Harris, which hasn’t been updated for more than 10 years.

Original repository: https://github.com/stephenharris/WordPress-Post-Type-Archive-Links

- Full compatibility with **WordPress 6.x**
- Updated for **PHP 7.4+ and PHP 8.x**
- Sanitization and security fixes
- Streamlined JavaScript and AJAX handling
- Updated plugin headers and internationalization ready

The original functionality is preserved, only modernized.
